AnatQC is a high-resolution "anatomical" MRI quality control pipeline built on the `FreeSurfer`_, `MRIQC`_, and `volumetric navigators`_ software packages. Working closely with neuroimaging experts, we designed an ergonomic user interface for the `XNAT`_ informatics and data management platform that allows users to quickly assess image quality and use those insights to get ahead of issues within the data acquisition workflow.
